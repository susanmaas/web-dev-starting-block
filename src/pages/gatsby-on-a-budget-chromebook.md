I got my first Chromebook a few years ago when I started getting interested in web development. I liked it a lot, and for most of my everyday needs it was fine. It had just one major catch: when it came to web development, it was very limited. I couldn't download the tools I wanted to use. I'd heard you could double boot Chromebooks with a Linux operating system at your own risk, but, at the time it was my only laptop, so I wasn't ready to take the jump. 

Fast forward to 2020. My Chromebook was long dead, victim of a cracked screen from getting dropped on the floor. By then, I was used to doing web development on a Macbook.

But Macs aren't cheap. I found myself wanting something I could use sitting on the couch with my kids jumping around me, or take on the bus without having to worry. 

I took another look at Chromebooks and was super excited to find out that times had changed! As of 2019, new Chromebooks are now released with Linux by default (still in beta).

I settled on a budget Chromebook: a Packard Bell Chromebook 314, which I got for less than 300 euros. It has 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and an Intel Celeron N4000 processor.

Getting Linux set up was incredibly easy. In a few clicks it was done. I recommend you watch [this video by Google] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRlh8LX4kQI&t=874s) on how Linux works on a Chromebook. It's about a half an hour long, but it gives a great introduction.

The next step was to see if I could actually do anything:

I downloaded VS Code, which runs just fine.

Then, I set up Gatsby.js and was able to create and work on a local site with no problem (yea!).

The only thing I've noticed so far is that programs are a little slow to open.

I haven't worked extensively with this stuff yet (I'll update this post if I find out more), but for now, it's working, which means I'm able to code and play around with Gatsby.js on a budget Chromebook.

Chromebooks may or may not fit your needs, but they're worth checking out, especially if you're a student or on a tight budget. I, for one, can't wait to see what the future of Linux on Chromebooks is going to bring!

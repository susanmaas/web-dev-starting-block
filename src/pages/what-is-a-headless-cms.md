You might have heard the term "headless CMS" floating around, but not been sure what it meant.

First, what is a CMS? 

CMS stands for "Content Management System". CMS's keep your site "content": your blog posts, images, etc. 

Ok, so what is a headless CMS?

A CMS that is headless has only a backend. You bring in the front end from somewhere else.

For example, if you've ever build a website with WordPress.org, if you went about it the classic way, you had both a front end (the part the person visiting your site sees) and backend (the part behind the scenes) to your site. You can also use WordPress as a headless CMS. In this case, you use WordPress only as the backend and use something else for the front end (like Gatsby).

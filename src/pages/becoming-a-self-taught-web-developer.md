title: "3 Things I've Learned About Becoming a Self-Taught Web Developer"

As self-taught web developers, we come from all kinds of backgrounds and experience levels. We have to do our own trailblazing, so sometimes we get lost. Here are 3 things I've found out so far my own rocky journey:

## 1. No course is enough ##
Don't get me wrong - I love courses, and lots of them are truly awesome. But I think at the beggining I thought I could sit down, go through a course, and be a confident (if inexperienced) web developer at the end.

But it doesn't work that way.

No course covers everything. 

Sometimes a course won't go in depth on something you want to know.

Other times a course will have whole sections on topics you don't want to spend a lot of time on.

There are even times you won't like the coding choices the person teaching the course makes.

Even if you love everything about a course, it's still not going to be enough.

Following a course will not make you a web developer. Taking the concepts, tearing them apart, and making something of your own will get you on your way.
## 2. You can get lost in the basics ##
You often hear people say you need to learn the basics before going on to libraries and frameworks. That's sound advice, but not if it stops you from moving forward.

You can get lost in a bottomless pit of trying to learn the basics - never feeling you quite know enough vanilla JavaScript to move on, drowning in tutorial hell, and struggling with motivation as all of your hard work seems to be getting you nowhere.

I've been there. It's not a fun place to be.

Sometimes picking up a library or a framework can help get you out of this rut. They help you build something more easily. This is good for a couple of reasons: 

1. It gives you a sense of accomplishment, which is good for motivation.

2. It can help you see the bigger picture of how the parts of a project fit together. Sometimes this can help clarify point that were giving you trouble. You can then go back and review those points, making your foundation stronger.

I’m not saying don’t learn the basics. I’m just saying, do what works for you as a learner. Use libraries or a frameworks if you think they will help you, but don’t depend on them. Keep looking under the hood, and fill in the gaps in your knowledge. There’s more than one way to build a strong foundation.
## 3. Podcasts are great ##
Learning web development takes a ton of time. But life is full of other things, so sometimes that time is hard to come by. 

Podcasts are great because you can make use of some of that "other" time to keep learning. They can help you keep up with what's going on in the industry. Even if you don't understand everything, it will all come together bit by bit as you continue learning. My favorite podcast is Syntax.fm, but there are loads to choose from.

Also, don't limit yourself to development podcasts. I also listen to Internet marketing podcasts, design podcasts, and writing podcasts because as I see it, all of those things work together.

So the next time you're doing something totally boring, like folding laundry, turn on a podcast and you won't lose that time.

title: "3 Things You Should Know about Becoming a Self-Taught Web Developer"

As self-taught web developers, we come from all kinds of backgrounds and experience levels. We have to do our own trailblazing, so sometimes we get lost. Here are 3 things I've found out so far my own rocky journey:

## 1. No course is enough ##
Don't get me wrong - I love courses, and lots of them are truly awesome. But I think that at the beggining I thought I could sit down, go through a course, and be a confident (if inexperienced) web developer at the end.

But it doesn't work that way.

No course covers everything. 

Sometimes a course won't go in depth on something you want to know.

Other times a course will have whole sections on topics that you don't want to spend a lot of time on.

There are even times you don't like the coding choices the person teaching the course makes.

Even if you take a course and love everything about it, it's still not going to be enough.

Following a course will not make you a web developer. Taking the concepts from a course, tearing them apart, and making something of your own will get you started on your way.
## 2. Learn the basics, but don't drown in them ##
You often hear people say you need to learn the basics before going on to libraries and frameworks. That's sound advice, but not if it stops you from moving forward.

Sometimes you can get lost in a bottomless pit of trying to learn the basics - never feeling you quite know enough vanilla JavaScript to move on, drowning in tutorial Hell, and struggling with motivation as all of your hard work seem to be getting you nowhere.

I've been there. It's not a fun place to be.

Sometimes picking up a library or a framework can help you build something more easily, which can then help you see the bigger picture of how things fit together. Then, you can go back and fill in blanks in your basic knowledge with a greater understanding of how they are a part of the whole, and why they are important.

I think the main thing is not to let yourself get lazy. Use a library or a framework if you feel like it can help you, but don't just depend on it and stop asking questions. Don't forget to look under the hood. Keep asking questions, and use what you learn to strengthen your foundation.
## 3. Listen to podcasts ##
Learning web development takes a ton of time. But life is full of other things, so sometimes that time is hard to come by. 

Podcasts are great because you can make use of some of that "other" time to keep learning. They can help you keep up with what's going on in the industry. Even if you don't understand everything they are talking about, it will all come together bit by bit as you continue learning. My favorite podcast is Syntax.fm, but there are loads to choose from.

Also, don't limit yourself to development podcasts. I also listen to Internet marketing podcasts, design podcasts, and writing podcasts because as I see it, all of those things work together.

So the next time you're doing something totally boring, like folding laundry, turn on a podcast and you won't lose that time.
